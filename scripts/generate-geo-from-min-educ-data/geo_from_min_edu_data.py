        Try and guess a geolocation for the given school.

        First, try to subset the schools set where to check: keep those with
        the same city only. If there's no match in the city, keep those in the
        same area.

        Next, filter the resulting set with two criterias:
            - A) Keep those with "similar" name, or
            - B) Keep those with "similar" address.

        Next, keep only the intersection of A and B. If it is empty,
        keep the union.

        Finally, in the resulting set of probable schools, compute the
        geographic distance between all of them. If the max distance is
        lower than some threshold, then just pick a random sample from the
